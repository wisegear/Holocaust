        <h2>Important</h2>
        <p>Please understand that this is a historical website that focuses on an event that did happen.  I apologise to the 
            majority of visitors who do not need to be told this, however, many still come to the site to try and deny the 
            holocaust which is not something I allow here.</p>
        <p>I do appreicate that many have strong feelings either on the Holocaust in general or specific events that took place.  
            Whilst I certainly want to encourage debate it must be within a reasonable manner that does not include denial that 
            the holocaust happened.</p>
        <p>Did specific events happen as generally understood?  Are numbers accurate?  These are open to discussion where there 
            is information to suggest otherwise or indeed lack of information. let's have a sensisble discussion about it.</p>   
        <p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
