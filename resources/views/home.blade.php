        <h1 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Update</h1>
        <p class="py-1">This is a new website, a rebuild of my old Holocaust History website built neatly 20 years ago.  
            Trying to go high tech by learning new web software and programming so it may take a while to get everything built.</p>
        <p class="py-1">The real challenge will be moving everything from an old html site of thousands of pages to this new database driven one :)</p>
        <p>Stay tuned!  Last updated 10th August 2021.</p>
