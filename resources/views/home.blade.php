        <h1 class="">Update</h1>
        <p class="">This is a new website, a rebuild of my old Holocaust History website built neatly 20 years ago.  
            Trying to go high tech by learning new web software and programming so it may take a while to get everything built.</p>
        <p class="">The real challenge will be moving everything from an old html site of thousands of pages to this new database driven one :)</p>
        <p>At this stage I have completed the sections that are going to require the most amount of manual work.  Uploading images, entering all the timeline events and so on.
            For now I am going to focus on building out the site design, tidy the code and start inputting.  The site is really messy as I have not been worrying about layout until now.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Stay tuned!  Last updated 16th August 2021.</p>
